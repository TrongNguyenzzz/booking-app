# Hotel Management Project

## Brief description of the project

This project simulates the hotel management system which allows users to make a reservation, and cancel a reservation. The website also has an introduction about different cities where the hotels are located with various pictures of famous places and best dishes recommendations of the town. Each user can create their own account and log in to reserve a hotel and retrieve all the information about their reservations.

## Instruction for testing the website

1. Clone the project. Then go into the booking-api file and run npm start. This command will run the api of the hotel management system on http://localhost:5050 so that the client side can call the APIs.
2. Go into src and run npm start. This will run and prompt the website on http://localhost:3000 so you can test all the features of the website.

### Disclaimer: All the information on the page such as hotel name, and address are what I came up with and they are not real but the information of each city is quite correct based on my research of different cities.

### I hope you enjoy the page!
